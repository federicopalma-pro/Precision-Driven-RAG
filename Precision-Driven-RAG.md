# Precision-Driven RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
### A Cutting-Edge Methodology for Hallucination-Free, Context-Rich Information Synthesis

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) methodology/pipeline integrates cutting-edge retrieval techniques to minimize hallucinations and deliver precise information from the queried documents.

### STEP #1 - Semantic Chunks
Documents are split into semantically meaningful chunks before being inserted into the vector database. Semantic chunking is a key process that carefully considers the relationships within the text and divides it into coherent and complete segments. This method plays a crucial role in preserving the integrity of the information during retrieval, ensuring more accurate and contextually appropriate outcomes.

### STEP #2 - RAPTOR: Advanced Retrieval with Recursive Summaries
According to the RAPTOR technique (https://arxiv.org/html/2401.18059v1), all semantic chunks are clustered and progressively summarized. RAPTOR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented models by recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text. This approach constructs a hierarchical tree with different levels of summarization from the bottom up. During inference, the RAPTOR model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across lengthy documents at various levels of abstraction. This method significantly improves retrieval, particularly for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. 

## STEP #3 - Metadata 
Each semantic chunk is backed by metadata that improves comprehension and accuracy in finding information. This metadata encompasses details like the document title, author, publication date, section headers, and keywords, offering context that facilitates the RAG process.

After completing these three steps, two chunk collections are saved in the vector database, and the system is ready to answer the user's question.

### STEP #4 -  User's Query Answer
The user's query is converted into a vector for efficient comparison with the document chunks stored in the vector database. The RAPTOR technique retrieves the k-most relevant chunks based on their similarity to the query from the RAPTOR collection. The Large Language Model (LLM) then utilizes these retrieved chunks to generate an answer. By leveraging the most similar and summarized chunks, the LLM can produce a precise and concise response that effectively addresses the user's query with accurate and contextually rich information. This process significantly reduces the likelihood of generating irrelevant information and enhances the overall reliability of the answer. However, it may result in the loss of some accompanying and minority information.

### STEP #5 - More Than Hypothetical Document Embeddings(HyDE)
Building on the previous steps, inspired by HyDE (https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hypothetical-document-embeddings-hyde), the answer obtained from the RAPTOR retrieval in STEP #4 is used to locate the k-most similar chunks from the collection of semantic chunks. This process helps recover any information that might have been lost in the initial answer while maintaining a high level of coherence and minimizing hallucinations. By integrating these additional relevant chunks, the system delivers a more complete and contextually rich response, significantly enhancing the reliability and depth of the information provided to the user.

### STEP #6 - Enriched Answer Generation
In the last step, the Large Language Model (LLM) generates an answer coherent with the answer obtained from Step #4. This answer is then expanded using the chunks and their associated metadata from Step #5. The metadata-enriched chunks provide additional context and details, allowing the LLM to respond comprehensively.

This approach/pipeline ensures that the final answer is accurately synthetic, rich in context, and well-supported by relevant data. The resulting response is a finely tuned synthesis of the most pertinent information, providing the user with a detailed and reliable answer to their query without hallucinations.
